Vulnerability: Information Disclosure - Server Headers / PHP Version [bWAPP bug 144]
Date: 2025-09-18

Summary:
- The web server responds with headers revealing server software and PHP version.
- Captured root headers saved as 'unrestricted_root_headers.txt' and page HTML saved in info_disclosure.html.

Impact:
- Disclosing server/PHP versions aids attackers in fingerprinting and finding version-specific exploits.
- Severity: Low-Medium (information leak that increases attack surface).

Remediation:
- Hide or minimize server version info in response headers (ServerTokens/ServerSignature off for Apache).
- Disable X-Powered-By or set to generic via php.ini (expose minimal info).
- Keep server and PHP up to date and monitor for CVEs.
