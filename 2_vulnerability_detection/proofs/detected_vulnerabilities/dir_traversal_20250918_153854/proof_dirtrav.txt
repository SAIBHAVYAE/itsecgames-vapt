Vulnerability: Directory traversal (file read)
Date: 2025-09-18

Summary:
- Sent a traversal payload to the directory traversal page.
- The server responded (saved as document_etc_passwd.html).
- Saved HTTP response headers for evidence.

Reproduction:
1) Login as bee/bug (security level low).
2) Select the Directory Traversal (Files) bug in the bWAPP portal (bug id 105).
3) POST the payload "../../../../etc/passwd" to the page form parameter.
4) Evidence files included in this folder.

Remediation:
- Properly validate and canonicalize file paths on the server.
- Deny any user-controlled path segments that include "../".
- Use safe APIs that map a file identifier to a canonical location.

Evidence (repo relative):
$OUTDIR
