Vulnerability: Cleartext HTTP (No TLS/SSL Support)
Date: 2025-09-19

Summary:
- Target: bWAPP running on 127.0.0.1:8080
- Attempted TLS handshake using openssl s_client.
- Result: "no peer certificate available", no ciphers negotiated.
- Confirms HTTPS is not enabled; traffic is sent in cleartext.

Impact:
- Credentials and sensitive data can be intercepted on the network.
- Susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

Remediation:
- Enable TLS (HTTPS) using a valid certificate.
- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- Use modern ciphers and disable weak protocols.
