F001,Target is bWAPP (intentionally vulnerable),Info,"Site title and downloads/vulnerabilities.txt confirm bWAPP testbed; contains 100+ known vulnerable cases","recon/bugs_and_downloads.txt","This is a lab intentionally exposing vulnerabilities; use non-destructive tests and document findings. No mitigation required for lab."
F002,Open services (22/80/443) ,Medium,"Open ports: SSH (22) OpenSSH 6.7p1, HTTP (80) Apache, HTTPS (443) Apache — surface for CVE mapping","nmap/itsecgames_initial.nmap,nmap/itsecgames_screenshot.txt","Map versions to CVE database, patch or isolate unnecessary services. Harden SSH or restrict by IP."
