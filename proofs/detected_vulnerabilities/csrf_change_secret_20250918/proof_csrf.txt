Vulnerability: Cross-Site Request Forgery (Change Secret)
Path: /csrf_3.php
Impact: Any attacker can trick a logged-in user into changing their secret without consent.
Evidence:
- Form has no anti-CSRF token.
- Hidden field "login=bee" is predictable.
- PoC stored at csrf_change_secret_poc.html demonstrates exploit.

Remediation:
- Implement CSRF tokens tied to the user session.
- Use SameSite cookies to reduce risk of external POSTs.
